# fifa_ML_Regression
Project Description üìÑ

‚ùÑÔ∏è Built a Random Forest Regressor model using scikit learn on European SOccer Database to predict 'overall_rating' based on other dependent variable.

# Data:
    European Soccer Database
      25k+ matches, players & teams attributes for European Professional Football

      About Dataset
      The ultimate Soccer database for data analysis and machine learning
      What you get:

      +25,000 matches
      +10,000 players
      11 European Countries with their lead championship
      Seasons 2008 to 2016
      Players and Teams' attributes* sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, including the weekly updates
      Team line up with squad formation (X, Y coordinates)
      Betting odds from up to 10 providers
      Detailed match events (goal types, possession, corner, cross, fouls, cards etc‚Ä¶) for +10,000 matches
      *16th Oct 2016: New table containing teams' attributes from FIFA !

      You can easily find data about soccer matches but they are usually scattered across different websites. A thorough data collection and processing has been done to make your life easier. I must insist that you do not make any commercial use of the data. The data was sourced from:

      http://football-data.mx-api.enetscores.com/ : scores, lineup, team formation and events

      http://www.football-data.co.uk/ : betting odds. Click here to understand the column naming system for betting odds:

      http://sofifa.com/ : players and teams attributes from EA Sports FIFA games. FIFA series and all FIFA assets property of EA Sports.
      
We have trained this model using Random Forrest Regression as it giving us 97% accuracy
